Range Card Android Application

Range Card is a GIS application, that uses Google Maps as a base map engine.

Inspired by the infantry and sharp shooter concept of the hand drawn 'range card'

Range Card provides a constant update range and bearing of all geo points on the map to a base reference point, which can be any geo point, 
or the user's GPS position. 

* Geo points can be added any where on the map, or to the current GPS location.
* Geo points can be edited and dragged to adjust.
* Long pressing points opens up detail view and allows editing.
* Vertical look angle is also computed and displayed in detailed view.
* Geo points can be of type 'target', 'position' or 'friendly'
* Range can be expressed in various units: m, ft, miles, NM, km.
* Bearings can be expressed as either relative or magnetic.
* The reticle in the center of the map updates range and bearing from reference point as you pan.
* Supports Lat / Lon and MGRS coordinates.
* Shows details of current GPS fix.
